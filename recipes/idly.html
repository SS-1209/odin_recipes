    <p>Idli is a traditional South Indian steamed rice cake that's soft and fluffy. Here's a step-by-step recipe to make idli:</p>
    <h4> ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
         <li>For batter</li>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups Idli rice (or parboiled rice)</li>
            <li>  1 cup Urad dal (split black gram)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Fenugreek seeds (methi seeds)</li>
            <li>  1/2 cup Cooked rice or poha (flattened rice)</li>
            <li> Salt to taste</li>
            <li> Water (as needed)</li>
        
        </ul>
        
    </ul>
    <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> RIse and soak</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Rinse the idli rice and urad dal separately until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>Soak the rice and fenugreek seeds together in enough water for at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Soak the urad dal separately in enough water for at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li> If using poha, soak it in water for 10 minutes before grinding.</li>

        </ul>
        <li>grind the batter</li>
        <ul>
              <li>Drain the water from the urad dal.</li>
               <li> In a wet grinder or a high-speed blender, grind the urad dal to a smooth and fluffy batter, adding water gradually (approx. 1/2 to 1 cup of water). The batter should be light and airy.</li>
               <li> Transfer the urad dal batter to a large bowl.</li>
               <li> Drain the water from the rice and fenugreek seeds.</li>
               <li> In the same grinder, grind the rice, fenugreek seeds, and soaked poha (or cooked rice) to a slightly coarse batter, adding water as needed (approx. 1/2 to 1 cup). The batter should have a grainy texture.</li>
               <li> Mix the rice batter with the urad dal batter. Add salt and mix well.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fermentation</li>
        <ul> Cover the batter and leave it in a warm place to ferment for 8-12 hours or overnight. The batter will rise and become airy. In cooler climates, it might take longer to ferment.

        </ul>
        <li>prepare idli steamer</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Grease the idli molds with a little oil or ghee.</li>
            <li>Pour the fermented batter into the molds, filling them about 3/4 full.</li>

            
        </ul>
        <li>steam the idlies</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in the idli steamer or pressure cooker (without the whistle/weight).</li>
            <li>  Place the idli stand in the steamer and cover with a lid.</li>
            <li> Steam the idlis on medium-high heat for about 10-15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the idli comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove the idli stand from the steamer and let it cool for a few minutes.</li>
        </ul>

    </ol>
    <p> Enjoy your home made idlies</p>
